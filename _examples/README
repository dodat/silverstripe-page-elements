copy these files in 
<yourtheme>/templates/Layout/

then open the cms admin, change the page type in the behaviour tab 
to 'Gridpage' then save.
You can then choose the template from the dropdown below.

Please note that the static "Gridpage_"-prefix in the template file name 
will be stripped in the admin.
